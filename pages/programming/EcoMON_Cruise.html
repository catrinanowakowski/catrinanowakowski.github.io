<h2> EcoMon Cruise </h2>

<p>My first research cruise I went out on the NOAA EcoMon survey for 18 days in 2021. The mission was to collect zooplankton and ichthyoplankton across the north Atlantic shelf. The stations are randomly distributed across many strata that are defined based on the bathymetry of the shelf, and at every station bongo nets are deployed, and CTD information is collected across a depth profile. At select stations, the CTD rosette is also deployed to collect water samples as well. </p>

<p> These data are important because it monitors the ecosystem response at a seasonal level over the course of many years. The survey has been in operation since the 70's in different capacities, and because this data was available, I was able to ask questions about long term change in the Gulf of Main food webs as part of my PhD thesis. Many people had to come before me to design research programs, make observations, and to archive and document the data to make the research I have done and contributed to possible. Having the opportunity to participate in the survey was important to me not only because I got to understand the data I was working on better, but also because I wanted to contribute to the collection of data for other scientists to use in the future as well. </p>


<h2>Learning D3 (a javascript data visualization computer programming package)</h2>

<p>I am using this page about the EcoMon Cruise to make my first graphic in D3. In undergrad I did a bit of programming in Java, but I haven't needed to since then. I am interested in making more dynamic visualization for the web and to share with a broader audience than the scientific community. </p>


<h2>The Cruise!</h2>

<p> Our cruise was the first one volunteers were aloud on after covid, and we left out of Newport Rhode Island! From there we ____ 
</p>

<p> The goal is to make a map using D3 of the cruise track, and to compare it to past springs, can also do a bit of a dashboard about community composition at each station, maybe a photo of the dominate copepod? Can I do a drag bar for the time line? ANd it also moves based on if someone clicks on a site? </p>

<p> Other ideas, put a photo of my drawing, the bird on Nick, the picture at the end with all of us, links to Jerry's Blogs, also link to the transition piece because it is related 

is there a way to add tags to the articles? that way the website knows what articles to show as related? </p>
