<h2> EcoMon Cruise </h2>

<p>My first research curise I went out on the NOAA EcoMon survey for 18 days in 2021. The mission was to collect zooplankton and ithoplankton across the north atlantic shelf. The stations are randomly distributed across many strata that are defined based on the bathimatry of the shelf, and at every station bongo nets are deployed, and CTD information is colected across a depth profile. At select stations, the CTD rosett is also deployed to collect water sampples as well. </p>

<p> These data are important because it monitors the ecosystem response at a seasonal level over the course of many years. The survey has been in opration since the 70's in different capicites, and because this data was avaliable, I was able to ask questions about long term change in the Gulf of Main food webs as part of my PhD thesis. Many people had to come before me to design research programs, make observations, and to arcive and document the data to make the reasearch I have done and contributed to possible. Haveing the opertunity to participate in the survey was important to me not only because I got to understand the data I was working on better, but also because I wnated to contiubte to the collection of data for other scientits to use in the future as well. </p>


<h2>Learning D3 (a java data visulization computer programming package)</h2>

<p>I am using this page about the EcoMon Cruise to make my first graphic in D3. In undergrad I did a bit of programming in Java, but I haven't needed to since then. I am interested in making more dynamic visulizations for the web and to share with a broader audiance than the scientific community. </p>


<h2>The Cruise!</h2>

<p> Our cruise was the first one voluenters were aloud on after covid, and we left out of Newport Rhode Island! From there we ____ 
</p>

<p> The goal is to make a map using D3 of the curise track, and to compair it to past springs, can also do a bit of a dashboard about community composition at each station, maybe a photo of the dominate copepod? Can I do a drag bar for the timeline? ANd it also moves based on if someone clicks on a site? </p>

<p> Other ideas, put a photo of my drawing, the bird on Nick, the picture at the end with all of us, links to Jerrys Blogs, also link to the transition piece because it is related 

is there a way to add tags to the articles? that way the website knows what articles to show as related? </p>
