		<h3>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h3>
		<h2> How I built this </h2>
		 <h4> Building a website wasn't about just digitalizing my CV for me, but it also has been a cool benefit to get a chance to look back and display my posters that took a lot of time for past me to make. My goal was to learn a new skill. With the current administration, and my background in oceans and climate, it feels like one of the few things that I do have control over in my current career path. </h4>

		 <h4>When I picture the job I have in the future, I am making things for all kinds of different people, from detailed derivatizations for other scientist, to something that is going to be accessible to wider audiences. To me, this felt like I should start learn how to build some of the backbone to displaying web elements. So now, I am building myself my own little platform where I can experiment and learn. And if someone else happens to be interested in it, that's great too!
		 </h4>

		 <h3>How I framed this project</h3>
		 <h4>When I start a project, one of the first things I consider is how many times am I going to have to perform a function, or need this feature. Usually, I then start to construct a function, and I make it as MODULAR as I can. </h4>
		 <h4>But what was interesting with this project, is that my goal was different from what I usually do. Usually, I am constructing an analysis or data visulization, where I pass data in, and get either slightly different data or a graphical component out. For this project, I am making a multiple static pages for another human to navigate, but also a file structure and map that I need to be able to scale and mold as my needs and know how grow. </h4>

		 <h3>First things first - pick something overly complicated for your index page. </h3>
		 <h4>I need a navigation pane, and two photos of the ocean that stretch my index.html page that make two fancy looking sections because I cannot just start with a simple background apparently. While, this lead to me breaking my page multiple times early on, it was useful to start with a challenging task (that I still havn't mastered, one photo is wider still just slightly wider than the other as I am writing this), because it meant I had to overcome a few barriers early before I had fleshed out my page infrastructure. </h4>

		 <h4>On a more useful note, I realized immediately, that I was not interested in copy and pasting the code for my navigation pane and footer for every static HTML file, and I needed a standardized way to do this. I found a solution that looks something like this: </h4>

		 <h4>I was skeptical about calling java script, but it seems like it is saved somewhere in the browser and will work, and as I look at other pages code (F12) I can see that this is standard practice. </h4>

		 <h4>Ok, great, I only change my navigation pane in one place, instead of many, and it always updates even if I forget a page. </h4>

		 <h3>Talk to your friends, espically the ones that actually study programing for a living, they know how to do things the easier way. </h3>

		 <h4>I first started trying to scale everything DIY, that is hard, and while it was good for me getting to know HTML syntax, it is not what I currently do now. Bootstrap does a lot of the work for you, and makes it work across different screen types as well. And while I know it was possible to build my site locally, it really helped to be shown how to do it </h4>

		 <h4>
		 	One of my friends told me about ___, which builds the page for you, and I thought that was interesting, but rather than learning the package, I ended up looking for an HTML package in R so I could make my own, and I found it "HTMLTOOLS"
