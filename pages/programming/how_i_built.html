		<h2> Why I built this </h2>
		 <p> Building a website hasn't been just about digitalizing my CV, but this has been an interesting benefit. It has enabled me to look back on work I have done in the past, and ask my self how do I give these projects a new home. When I started building my website, my goal was to learn a new skill. With the current administration, and my background in oceans, climate, and now wetlands, it feels like one of the few things that I do have control over in my current career path. </h4>

		 <h4>When I picture the job I have in the future, I am making things for all kinds of different people, from detailed derivatizations for other scientist, to something that is going to be accessible to my parents and family. A skill set both of these groups share is navigating the Internet and digital content. Knowing that I can meet my audiences needs this way, I felt like I had a direction to start in: learning both some front and back end components to displaying web elements. Now, I am building myself my own personal platform where I can experiment and learn, and this thread is intended to document my process.
		 </p>

		 <h3>How I framed this project</h3>
		 <p>When I start a project, one of the first things I consider is how many times am I going to have to perform a task or need a specific feature. This helps me start to outline and constructing modular functions and to identify what variables are the most important. </p>

		 <p>With this project, I quickly realized that my goal is different from what I usually do. Normally, I construct an analysis or data visualization. Data goes in to a function and what comes out is  either slightly different data or a graphical component. For this project, I am designing a series of file paths for another human to navigate, and this map of connections needs to scale and grow as my needs and know how evolve. </p>

		 <h3>To get started, I picked something overly complicated for my index page. </h3>
		 <p>The home page of your website is your "Index.html" file. And I decided immediately that I needed a navigation pane, and two photos of the ocean that stretch across the full page that make two distinct sections. While, this lead to me breaking my page multiple times early on, it was useful to start with a challenging task (that I still haven't fully mastered), because it meant I had to overcome a few barriers early before I had fully committed to a design and  infrastructure. </p>

		 <p>In attempting to make an *ascetic* home page, I realized immediately, that I was not interested in copy and pasting the code for my navigation pane and footer for every static HTML file, and I needed a standardized way to do this. I found a solution that looks something like this: </p>

		 <h5> 
		 	Simplification of the build_page() function (10/05/2025)

		 	HTML
		 		head (not the same as header)
		 			title
		 			script
		 			bootstrap
		 			style
		 		head

		 		body
		 			navigation
		 			body
		 			footer 
		 		body
		 	HTML

		 </h5>
		<p>
			What if I want to add a new navigation option, or change the footer one day, and I don't want to re render each static page? 

			I save a nav.html file, and a footer.html file, and use "//code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js" to call the same file each time the page is rendered in your browser. This means, every time any page is loaded, it is getting the navigation and footer information from the same source. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This means I only have to make a style file, and body file for each page. Then when I compile the final html file in R, they get sandwiched into the standard outline. 
		</p>
