<p> In 2021__, I was paired with Eunhyung Chung as part of a colaboration between the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the University of Rhode Island (URI) to develop an art piece inspired by my Ph.D. research. Eun has a master’s degree in Sculpture, and at the time was working on a master’s of Art, __and Education. Together we developed a concept that uses affective, emotional, approaches to visualizing the data from my thesis - changes in zooplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine.</p>

	<p> Eun was inspired by the transitions, and we wanted to use transparancy to communicate how one zooplankton was declining in abundance over another. By using a resin, we were able to acomplish this, and through the addtion of color, we could show both the mixing of ocean currents, and the resuting warming of the Gulf of Maine. </p>
