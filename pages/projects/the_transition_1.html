	<h4> In 2021 I was paired with Eunhyung Chung as part of a collaboration between the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the University of Rhode Island (URI) to develop an art piece inspired by my Ph.D. research. Eun has a master’s degree in Sculpture, and at the time was working on a master’s of Teaching + Learning in Art + Design. Together we developed a concept that uses affective, emotional, approaches to visualizing the data from my thesis - changes in Zooplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine. See the images below for some examples of what I shared with her early on!</h4>

	<h4> Eun was inspired by the transitions, and we wanted to use transparency to communicate how one Zooplankton was declining in abundance over another. By using a resin, we were able to accomplish this, and through the addition of color, we could show both the mixing of ocean currents, and the resulting warming of the Gulf of Maine. </h4>
