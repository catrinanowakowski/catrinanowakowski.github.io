	<p> In 2021__, I was paired with Eunhyung Chung as part of a collaboration between the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the University of Rhode Island (URI) to develop an art piece inspired by my Ph.D. research. Eun has a master’s degree in Sculpture, and at the time was working on a master’s of Art, __and Education. Together we developed a concept that uses affective, emotional, approaches to visualizing the data from my thesis - changes in Zooplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine.</p>
