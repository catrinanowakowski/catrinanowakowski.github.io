I revamped two hurricane models to include higher resolution calculations, surface roughness interactions, and many other features, all working in Fortran.

		<p> Working with Marina Astitha at the University of Connecticut on Hazardous Agal Blooms in Lake Erie set my career on a track I didn't even know how to picture when I first started. It involved a lot of first for me, from airport travel to applying statistics. I even got to work with folks at the US EPA's Office of Research and Development, where I now hold a postdoc position! I attended my first conference (CMAQ in The Research Triangle area, NC) and won the best student poster! I learned a lot at this conference including how to talk about my work as well as how to engage others in what I am excited about. While the poster is  </p>
