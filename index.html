		<p>My name is Catherine, but I go by Catrina and I am an Earth Systems Researcher. Currently I am and ORISE Postdoc with the US. EPA working on the National Aquatic Resources Survey to look at nitrogen processing in the nations wetlands. I have a Ph.D. in Oceanography from the University of Rhode Island, and a Bacholors in Environmental Engineering from the University of Connecticut.

		<p><br>
		   I have a wide range of intersts and experiance, and my goal is to highlight them with this webpage. I am building it from the bottom up in html and javaScript using GitHub Pages. To keep the design modular, I wrote a simple complier using the package "htmltools" in R! In addition to learning new coding languages, I am also interested in data visulization, science and art colaborations, as well as the ocean and sustainablity.
