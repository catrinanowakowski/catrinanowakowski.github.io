		use this one to auto fill a template, I think I need to make a template, and than seperatly write the "body" for every page that way if I change the template, I can regenerate all of the pages with out having to make simple edits across everything. This will happen outside of the repository I think. I should buid a sperate one, and use it to write things, and then send them into this repository to save. </p>
